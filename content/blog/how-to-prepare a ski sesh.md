# How to prepare a ski session

## How to prepare your day skiing

The idea of this post came to me after my girlfriend and I realized we forgot her son's skiboots as we were parked down to the telepheric. We were so disapointed. Actually, it was just 1-hour drive, and the first day of the season, with wonderful weather.

We already heard Gabriel's shouts, as he was so disapointed not to ski as we promised the previous days...

As a basic human, my first reaction was to blame my girlfriend ! it was clear, that it was her role to pack the skiboots in the car, wasn't it? Clearly not. As always, the lack of communication is the root of many disorders... I planned to write a checklist for my girlfriend on how I imagine she would prepare a skiday. Finally, I thought I could just share these few points to others. Not that I think I have the perfect way to organize this...But since I am very lightminded, I have been forced to organise myself.

You understand, that I do not advice anyone to copy this organisation, but some may cherry pick some of these ideas (most of them are basics) that allow me to ski in good conditions most of the time!



- General organisation

    Each object has its place, and each place has its object

    Every object should come back to its place Asap.

- Boot Heaters

    It could seem a bit old-fashion / mou but, it is so cool to have warm at least dry skiboots

    They are stored in my skiboots, which are stored in their bag. As soon as I quit my skiboots, my bootheaters are in, even if they are not plugged in ie. in the car. When I come back home, I plug them so that I can re use them the day after.


- Neck warmers

    I have differents ones : really light ones, just preventing the wind to access my neck, a warmer one, and a bataclavia for powder days,

    I always take more than one, since they can become really uncomfortable to wear if it is snowing/raining

    This is even more relevant, since the COVID and since I wear these neckwarmers as masks in the liftqueues, and lifts.

- Gloves

    I have 3 different pairs : a lighter one for touring or warm conditions, a pair of mittens, and a standard one.
    I always take at least 2 of them everytime I go out for a day. I adapt the choice to the weather conditions.

- Goggles

    I am mostly a google wearer, and I am not so fan of changing my lens on the slopes, which would also mean bringing an extra lens on the slopes. Therefore, I use photochromic lenses, which completely satisfy myself. (I know that lots of people complain about them, but i does the job for me ! )

    Since these goggles can always be scratched or become wait after a pow crash, I also take sunglasses with me.

    It also allows me to trade my goggles for these sunglasses in case we want to have a drink on a terrace.

- Skibackpack

    Airbag?

    How Big?

    Ski carry

    Gogglepocket

    Could change for a more versatile one ?

    Integrated back protection

- Back protection

    If backpack, I consider it is ok

    I could consider an integrated backprotection backpack

    If I stay in the resort and can afford to ski without a backpack, I wear a flexible backprotection

- 3 Layout-wear system

    I wear a compressive longsleeve t-shirt

    For the style, I wear a technical t-shirt above

    As a warm layout, I wear a technical puffer for cold days, or a lighter one, or even nothing

    I usually take both of them out, since I can never decide myself which one I should take before I am on the mountain.

    As a shell, I recently invested (it really seem to be an invest, given the cost) in a 3L-Gore Tex Pro. There are a lot of resources on this topic on the internet. I think I will be able to use it for other activities than skiing or skitouring, ig. hiking, or bike-to-working.

- Headwear

    I wear an helmet as I am skiing, but really do not like my look with it. It passes if I wear my goggles at the same time.

    Since I am really picky with the state of my goggles, and since they are really expensive (I've seen people completely scratching their brand new goggles, while taking their skis out of the car...), I put them in their goggle-pocket as soon as I am not riding...leaving me with an helmet without goggle on the head...
    ⇒ I immediately take the helmet off, and attach it to my backpack...Of course, it is not a good idea to do so if it is snowing/raining, since your helmet will be a bit wet...

    For cold days, I just put my neckwarmer a bit higher than usual, so that it covers my ears.

    For even colder days, I use the bataclavia

    I also take a cap with me, because....it is stylish ! I usually wear it until I put my helmet (ie. my goggles) on my head

- SunCream

    Combo lipstick / sun cream

- What stays in the car

    Ski pack

    raclette à ski

    handCream

    phone charger

- Tools

    Living in switzerland, I just take a swissknife with me, and until now, it covered all my needs ig. cutting some "saucisson", open a bottle of wine if necessary, of modifing settings on my of friends' skis/snowboards

    je laisse la rondelle (basket) de poudre.
